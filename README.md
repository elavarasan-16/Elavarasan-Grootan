 *Think of a scenario where the user needs to log in to an application and unfortunately
he forgot his username. Now you are going to provide a self-service system to the user.

Following is one of the proposed BOT based solutions to handle such a case & feel free to
modify/improvise it as you wish.


Notes for Backend Task:
 You need to create 3 APIs
    1. An API to get 5 random questions
    2. An API to validate the answers
    3. An API to send a username in an Email (Optional)


Notes for Frontend Task:
   1. Design a screen with a username & forgot username option
   2. Design a screen to display the questions received from API (You can use something
    like this https://botui.org/)
   3. Design a screen to Show the Success or Failure of the flow.
